This is a simple guide for git, and some useful links for git basics.

- [learnGitBranching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/): An interactive git visualization to challenge and educate!
- [GitHub Git Cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- [Git Reference](http://git-scm.com/docs): Offical documentation and other stuff.
- Commandline helpers: [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) (which includes a bunch of Git aliases and Git-related plugins, good enough when default), [git-radar](https://github.com/michaeldfallen/git-radar) (for even greed guys).

TODO:

- common problems, Merge, Pull rebase, gitignore, gitkeep, CRLF, gitattributes

It's a better idea to split them into different files
