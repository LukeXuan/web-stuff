This is a simple guide for git, and some useful links for git basics.

- [Git Reference](http://git-scm.com/docs): Offical documentation and other stuff.
- [learnGitBranching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/): An interactive git visualization to challenge and educate!
- [GitHub Git Cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)

TODO:

- common problems, Merge, Pull rebase, gitignore, gitkeep, CRLF, gitattributes
- git commandline helpers, alias, zsh etc.

It's a better idea to split them into different files
